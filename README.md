# CSC413 Final Project
# Math-BERT-T5 Hybrid Model for Mathematical Reasoning

This repository contains the final project for CSC413, where we develop a hybrid model combining Math-BERT and T5 for advanced mathematical reasoning tasks. The project focuses on leveraging the strengths of both Math-BERT (optimized for mathematical text understanding) and T5 (a powerful text-to-text transformer model) to solve challenging mathematical problems.

## Project Overview

Mathematical reasoning is a complex task that requires both comprehension of mathematical language and problem-solving skills. By combining Math-BERT's ability to understand mathematical expressions and T5's general-purpose reasoning capabilities, this project aims to create a hybrid model capable of tackling:

- Mathematical equation solving
- Proof generation
- Word problem analysis

The repository includes code, experimental results, and analysis.
